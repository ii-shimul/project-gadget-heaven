## React Fundamentals Used
- **React Router** for managing routes and navigation between pages.
- **React Context API** for managing global state across different components (Cart, Wishlist).
- **React Hooks**:
  - `useState` for managing local state in components.
  - `useEffect` for side-effects like fetching data and updating the document title.
  - `useContext` for accessing shared state (Cart/Wishlist).
  - `useLocation` for dynamically changing the background color based on the route.
- **React-Helmet** for managing dynamic document titles and favicons.
  
## Data Management
- **Context API**: Used to manage the global state for Cart and Wishlist. This allows components to access and update the state without prop drilling.
- **LocalStorage**: Used for persisting Cart and Wishlist data across page reloads, ensuring the state is maintained even after refreshing the page.
